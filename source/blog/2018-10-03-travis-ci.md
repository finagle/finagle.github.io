TravisCI [announced](https://blog.travis-ci.com/2018-05-02-open-source-projects-on-travis-ci-com-with-github-apps) that it is moving open source projects from [travis-ci.org](https://travis-ci.org/) to [travis-ci.com](https://travis-ci.com/) which will use [Github Apps](https://developer.github.com/v3/apps/) for a tigther integration with Github.

We plan on working with TravisCI to migrate the entirety of the [Finagle Org](https://github.com/finagle) ([github.com/finagle](https://github.com/finagle)). However, we wanted to alert the community that as part of this move, repositories under the [Finagle Org](https://github.com/finagle) will **lose their TravisCI build history**. We don't expect that this is a big deal for projects in the org but wanted to give folks a heads up.

We expect this transition to happen in the next few weeks. Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns!
