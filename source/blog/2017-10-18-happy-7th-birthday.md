Seven years ago a [simple commit][first_commit] got Finagle's open source repository
started. Finagle [began][blog_post] as a means of dealing with the complexity and
fragility of distributed systems issues here at Twitter. While
distributed systems remain complex and it is not a silver bullet,
Finagle has enabled a great many to build resilient, high throughput
applications.

The pace of development remains high â€” with over 1,600 commits in the
past year across [Finagle][finagle], [Finatra][finatra], [Util][util], [Scrooge][scrooge], and [TwitterServer][twitterserver].
It is unlikely to slow down with 13 devs on the core team. Externally
the community [adoption][adoption] is broad, spawned a [company][company], and inspired
versions in [C++][cpp] and [Rust][rust].

With a wide user base numbering into the hundreds of services, our
development philosophy has changed focus over the years. There has
been a shift to capabilities that service owners get for free â€” simply
redeploy with the latest version and voilÃ ! Examples include retry
budgets, HTTP/2, improved throughput, and admission control with
automatic retries among others.

While you'd now consider a robust RPC library table stakes in
microservice deployments, that was not the case in 2010. We're proud of
Finagle's consistent progress and excited about Future\[Finagle\].

Here's to the next 7 years,
