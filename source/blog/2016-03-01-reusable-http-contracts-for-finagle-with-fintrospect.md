# Reusable HTTP contracts with Fintrospect

## overview 
At my current workplace, we've been migrating our architecture stack to a Microservice-based approach and from the application side a few core requirements kept coming up. We wanted our apps to be able to easily:

- generate and serve live API contract documentation - in our case [Swagger][swagger] docs with [JSON schema][jsonschema] example
- automatically validate and respond to invalid requests (missing or invalid parameters)
- marshall objects to and from HTTP requests in various messaging formats in a type-safe way, for both server and client-side services
- provide a low effort way of creating Fake servers for our downstream dependencies for CDC-based testing

To solve these requirements, [Fintrospect][fintrospect] was devised. The library provides a thin layer over the top of Finagle HTTP that helped us solve the above requirements with minimal ongoing effort. 

This post describes a brief overview of the main features of the library. Full documentation can be found at the [project site][fintrospect], or for the impatient there is a Github repo with a [demo application][demo].

## defining HTTP contracts
An HTTP contract is created by defining a ```RouteSpec``` which takes some typed-parameters at a particular path:

```scala
val activeOnly = Header.optional.boolean("listOnlyActive")
val employeeName = Query.required.string("name")
val departmentId = Path.integer("departmentId")

val listEmployeesContract = RouteSpec("search for all employees in a particular group")
  .taking(activeOnly)
  .taking(employeeName)
  .at(Get) / "search" / departmentId
```

Body parameters are handled in much the same way... with built in support for both JSON and XML.

## serving the contract

#### basics
In order to serve the contract, we need to bind it to a Finagle ```Service```. Dynamic Path parameters (in this case ```departmentId```) are read from the URL and injected on a request-by-request basis. Other parameters can be retrieved in a type-safe way through applying the ```<--``` operator to the request. Bad requests (missing/malformed parameters) have already been dealt with automatically by this point, so no validation logic is required:

```scala
def listEmployees(departmentId: Integer) = Service.mk[Request, Response] { request => 
  val activeFlag: Option[Boolean] = activeOnly <-- request
  val employeeNameInstance: String = employeeName <-- request
  ...
}

val listEmployeesRoute = listEmployeesContract bindTo listEmployees
```

Routes which all live in a common context are then bundled into a ```ModuleSpec``` (which can themselves be combined), and the result is converted into a standard Service which can be served as usual using the Finagle ```Http``` API:

```scala
Http.serve(":9000", ModuleSpec(Root / "employee").withRoute(listEmployeesRoute).toService)
```

#### creating the HTTP response
Fintrospect includes support for natively creating responses using a number of different protocols, and also ships with bindings for creating JSON messages from [a bunch][supportedjson] of popular JSON libraries, including the auto case-class conversion support included in [Argonaut][argonaut], and more recently [Circe][circe]. There are various mechanisms of creating the Responses, but the below method is the most compact:

```scala
import Argonaut.ResponseBuilder._
import Argonaut.JsonFormat._

case class Employee(name: String)

val resp: ResponseBuilder[Json] = Ok(encode(Employee("Bob"))).withHeaders("MyCustomHeader" -> "value")
```

The very first call in the example above is a standard Finagle ```Status``` object which is implicitly converted to a ```ResponseBuilder```. We also get implicit conversion to a ```Future[Response]```, so an implementation of the server method above could simply be:

```scala
def listEmployees(departmentId: Integer) = Service.mk[Request, Response] { request => 
  Ok(encode(List(Employee(employeeName <-- request))))
}
```

#### custom parameters and bodies
Parameter and body type support includes a number of factory methods for various primitive types (as well as JSON and XML), but it is also simple to provide support for your own types - you just need to provide the mechanism to serialise and deserialise the type:

```scala
val spec = ParameterSpec[EmployeeId]("employeeId", None, NumberParamType, 
  s => EmployeeId(parseInt(s)), id => id.value.toString)

val employeeId = Query.required(spec)
val id: EmployeeId = employeeId <-- request
```

Body specifications are declared in the same way, by defining a ```BodySpec```.

#### generating the documentation
Another of our requirements was to provide live documentation for the services - and this is can be auto-generated by providing a ```ModuleRenderer``` implementation when defining the ```ModuleSpec```. The documenation URL appears at the root context of the module - in this case http://localhost:9000/employee :

```scala
val findEmployeeContract = RouteSpec("employee lookup")
  .returning(NotFound -> "so such employee")
  .returning(Ok -> "here you go", encode(Employee("Bob")))
  .at(Get) / Path.int("id", "the employee id")
```

In order to interact with the API here, you'll need an instance of the Swagger UI. Normally, these are hosted yourself, but you can see an [example instance][swaggerpetstore].

All parameter locations are represented in the documentation, and in the case of JSON messages (when examples are provided for the responses or bodies), [JSON Schema][jsonschema] is generated to provide a breakdown of the expected object format.

## consuming the contract
The HTTP contract can also be bound to an outgoing Finagle Client ```Service```, which creates a callable ```RouteClient```. Typed values can be bound to the contract parameters using ```-->``` and are auto-marshalled into the outgoing request:

```scala
val client = listEmployeesContract bindToClient Http.newService("localhost:9001")
val response: Future[Response] = client(activeOnly --> true, employeeName --> "bob", departmentId --> 5)
```

## low-effort fake HTTP servers
The ability to reuse the defined HTTP contract for both the server and the client allows us to very easily create a Fake HTTP server for a downstream dependency. The ```TestHttpServer``` is provided for this purpose, allowing you easily mount single or multiple downstream contracts:

```scala
class FakeEmployeeServer (port: Int) {
  def listEmployees(departmentId: Integer) = Service.mk[Request, Response] { request =>
        ... fake logic goes here ...
  }

  val routes = new ServerRoutes[Response] {
    add(listEmployeesContract bindTo listEmployees)
  }

  def start() = new TestHttpServer(port, routes).start()
 }
```

One advantage of this kind of fake server setup is the ability to define CDC-style tests to ensure the integrity of the contract between the real and fake dependency. Another is that the effects of network problems such as timeouts can be easily be realistically recreated by building these into the fake server implementation.


## web content and templating
There is built-in support for [Mustache][mustache] and [Handlebars][handlebars] templating engines. View models which implement the ```View``` trait will automatically render in the identically named view file, which is converted by a ```Render<Engine>View``` Filter. Here's an example Web module for Mustache which uses the filter at a module-level, and describes itself as an XML SiteMap:

```scala
// maps to IndexView.mustache in the classpath
case class IndexView(title: String) extends View

def index() = Service.mk { request: Request => IndexView("my great website") } 

ModuleSpec[View](Root, new SiteMapModuleRenderer(new URL("http://my.great.site")),
  new RenderMustacheView(Html.ResponseBuilder, "templates")
).withRoute(RouteSpec("index").at(Get) bindTo index)
```

## fin
And that's a whirlwind tour of some of the features of Fintrospect - you can see the full feature set in the documentation at the [project site][fintrospect]. For the impatient there is a Github repo with an entire (tested) [demo application][demo]. 

Alternatively, you can go straight to Maven for the base SBT install:

```scala
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "io.github.daviddenton" %% "fintrospect" % "12.4.0",
  "com.twitter" %% "finagle-http" % "6.33.0"
)
