We have integrated [cla-assistant.io](CLA Assistant) with the Finagle Github repository.

Due to lack of discoverability, not everyone has been consistent about signing [Twitter's existing CLA](https://engineering.twitter.com/opensource/cla). We believe that this will be less of a burden than manually checking CLAs against an internal list.
