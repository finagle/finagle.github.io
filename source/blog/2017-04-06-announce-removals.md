As mentioned in our [spring planning notes](https://finagle.github.io/blog/2017/03/20/spring-planning/), we are sunsetting a number of modules that have been unsupported or exist in a zombie-like state.

* finagle-ostrich4
* finagle-kestrel
* finagle-stream
* finagle-native
* finagle-mdns
* util-eval
* ostrich

The upcoming April release will be their final one. Due to Ostrich being a separate project it will not be removed immediately.

Please feel free to ask questions on the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/finaglers).
